### Problem Defination - 
Developed an application using Springboot and servlets, which performs CRUD operations on various financial transactions.

### Application Functionalities
* Create – We can create new transactions by adding the following fields – 
  1. Name(of the uploader)
  2. Date of the transaction
  3. Transaction type
  4. Date of initiation
* Update – We can update the transaction details of the respective transaction
* Delete – Transaction can be deleted after clicking the delete button. An alert prompts you to confirm the delete operation
* Search – We can search for particular transactions by using the appropriate field filters
